# Unigram-Language-Model
This program reads all the files in a directory and counts the total frequency of each word present. Each file is cleaned to omit SGML tags, punctuation, symbols, digits, and any other unacceptable characters. This is achieved using two distinct regular expressions within list comprehensions. Unnecessary whitespace is removed using the strip method. Utilizing the split and lower methods, words are split by whitespace and converted to lowercase. The lists are combined and converted into a dictionary, which also contains the counts for each respective word. The dictionary is sorted in descending order and the total tallies are printed to the screen. The program contains an additional function to verify a file is not empty.
